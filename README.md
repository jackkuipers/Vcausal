# Vcausal
Code to compute the variance of causal estimators for binary v-structures to accompany the article "The variance of causal effect estimators for binary v-structures", Kuipers and Moffa, Journal of Causal Inference, 10, 90-105 (2022) [https://doi.org/10.1515/jci-2021-0025 and arXiv version at https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09181]

The R file VcausalMC.R runs Monte Carlo simulations, while Vcausalfns.R and the Maple file contain functions to compute the numerical result.

The code now also computes the covariance of the different causal estimators.
